Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. The IAM policy does not adhere to the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
2. The LoadBalancer does not have HTTP to HTTPS redirection.
3. The VPC Security Groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, violating AWS recommendations.
4. Server-side encryption and logging are not enabled for S3 buckets.
5. TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance.

1. Set IAM policies to disallow root user and enforce MFA, as well as restrict access permissions and provide specific rights.
2. The Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS. 
3. Limit traffic on the Security Groups to only allow 80 and 443, and also reference another security group for accessing AWS resources within the VPC.
4. Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging.
5. Disable all other unnecessary ports on the EC2 instance.
